# START OF LINE
Welcome!  This is my blog.  It is here that I will write things.
Perhaps things pertaining to science.  Perhaps random musings.  You do
not know!  That is a part of the mystery here.  Well, that or a lack
of direction.  Mostly a lack of direction.  Let's establish some
direction.

Here's what I'm going to cover:
- My experiences with science and technology
- Many of my projects and the process by which I create them
- My thoughts on new science and technology
- Ideas for possible things to create
- My experience learning new things

I hope you find some value in the things I speak of here.
